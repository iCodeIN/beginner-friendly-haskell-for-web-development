## How to run the tests
```
make db_test
make test
```

## How to make docker build
### 1. Build a builder image as a building environment, which includes stack for compiling and libpq for PostgreSQL
```
make builder-image
```
It builds a `zhangchiqing/stack-libpq` image as the builder.

#### Why do we need a builder image?
Since we don't need the compiler on production, it's a different image than the final deployed image. The builder image is just for building the executable binary.

And since we want to run the application on Linux, the code has to be compiled under Linux.

### 2. Build the executables under Linux in Docker
```
make docker-build
```
This compiles to executable binaries for Linux and place it in the mounted volume at `a-simple-http-service/.stack-work/install/x86_64-linux/lts-11.1/8.2.2/bin`.

The initial build takes a long time, but since we cache the build (the `~/.stack` folder). The second build takes only seconds if there is no change. Big thanks to stack!

### 3. Build a deployment base image
```
make deployment-base-image
```
It builds a `zhangchiqing/pid1-libpq` image as the base image for deployment.

### 4. Build a deployment image
```
make deployment-image
```
It builds a `zhangchiqing/a-simple-http-service` image

## How to run as docker container
```
make run-docker
```
